<h2>ZOMBIE KARENS!</h2>

<h3>-THE GAME-</h3>
<p>You are having a nice day at the local park when you feel a dark presence. Screeches suddenly ring out of the woods, filled with the anger
of a thousand manager requests. As the crys become louder you realize you're surrounded by Karens, not just any Karens.....Zombie Karens!</p>

<b>The goal of this game is to eliminate the wave of Karens by using your mouse to point and shoot. After a certain amount of hits the Karens 
life will be drained and there will be one less annoyance in the park. Be careful, I hear a super Karen is lurking somewhere and has already 
gone to Parks and Rec over your picnic.</b>
